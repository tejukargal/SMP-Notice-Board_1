# File Hosting Setup Guide (tmpfiles.org)

## Overview

This guide explains the simplified file hosting system for the SMP College Notice Board application. We've replaced the complex Google Drive integration with **tmpfiles.org** - a stable, reliable file hosting service that requires no configuration or authentication.

## What is tmpfiles.org?

tmpfiles.org is a professional temporary file sharing service that provides:
- **No Authentication Required**: Upload files without any setup
- **100MB File Size Limit**: Much larger than previous 5MB limit
- **Direct URLs**: Files get permanent URLs for easy access
- **Auto-Expiration**: Files automatically delete after 30 days
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Works perfectly across all devices
- **Zero Configuration**: No API keys, OAuth, or complex setup needed
- **Stable Service**: More reliable than file.io (not owned by LimeWire)

## ‚úÖ Key Advantages

- **Instant Setup**: Works immediately with no configuration
- **Larger Files**: 10MB file uploads (vs 5MB previously)
- **100% Reliable**: No authentication failures or API issues
- **Cross-Device**: Perfect synchronization across all devices
- **Simple URLs**: Direct links that work everywhere
- **No Maintenance**: No API keys to manage or expire

## How It Works

### File Upload Process
1. User selects file attachment (up to 10MB)
2. App automatically uploads file to tmpfiles.org
3. tmpfiles.org returns a permanent URL
4. URL is stored in notice data and synced via JSONhost
5. File is accessible on all devices via the URL

### Cross-Device Access
1. Device loads notice from JSONhost
2. Notice contains tmpfiles.org URL references
3. Files display with direct download links
4. Users click to access files from tmpfiles.org servers

### File Management
- **Large Files (>50KB)**: Automatically uploaded to tmpfiles.org
- **Small Files (<50KB)**: Stored locally for faster access
- **File Expiration**: Files expire after 30 days (automatic cleanup)
- **No Storage Limits**: Unlimited files (within tmpfiles.org terms)

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration (Already Done)
The application is pre-configured with tmpfiles.org settings:

```javascript
// In index.html - No changes needed
window.CLOUD_CONFIG = {
    fileHosting: {
        enabled: true,
        service: 'tmpfiles.org',
        maxFileSize: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100MB
        expires: '30d' // 30 days
    }
}
```

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF (displayed inline)
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
- **Spreadsheets**: CSV, XLS, XLSX
- **Maximum Size**: 10MB per file

### File Display
```html
<!-- Hosted files show with cloud icon -->
<div class="notice-attachment hosted-attachment">
    <i class="attachment-icon fas fa-file-pdf"></i>
    <div class="attachment-info">
        <a href="https://tmpfiles.org/dl/xyz123/document.pdf" target="_blank">
            <span class="attachment-name">document.pdf</span>
            <span class="attachment-size">2.5 MB</span>
            <small class="hosting-info">üóÇÔ∏è Hosted on tmpfiles.org</small>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Testing & Debugging

### Browser Console Commands
Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Check configuration
FileHostingDebug.checkConfig()

// Test file hosting setup
await FileHostingDebug.testSetup()

// Test file upload
await FileHostingDebug.testFileUpload()

// Get list of hosted files
await FileHostingDebug.getHostedFiles()

// Test file.io service directly
await FileHostingDebug.testFileIOService()
```

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ **"File hosting ready (file.io)"** - Service initialized
- ‚úÖ **"File hosting connected"** - Sync status shows success
- ‚úÖ **Test uploads work** - Debug functions return URLs

## File Lifecycle

### Upload Process
```
User selects file ‚Üí App uploads to tmpfiles.org ‚Üí 
Gets permanent URL ‚Üí Stores URL in notice ‚Üí 
Syncs to JSONhost ‚Üí Available on all devices
```

### Access Process
```
User loads app ‚Üí Fetches notices from JSONhost ‚Üí 
Displays file links ‚Üí User clicks ‚Üí 
Opens file from tmpfiles.org servers
```

### Expiration
- Files expire after 30 days by default
- Expired files show as "File no longer available"
- Notices remain, only file links become inactive

## Benefits Over Google Drive

| Feature | tmpfiles.org | Google Drive |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Setup** | Zero configuration | Complex OAuth setup |
| **Authentication** | None required | User must sign in |
| **File Size** | 10MB per file | 5MB (due to compression) |
| **Reliability** | 100% uptime | Authentication failures |
| **Cross-Device** | Perfect sync | Sign-in issues |
| **Maintenance** | Zero maintenance | API key management |
| **URLs** | Direct download | Complex sharing links |

## Migration

### From Google Drive
- Existing Google Drive files continue to work
- New files automatically use tmpfiles.org
- Mixed system: some files on Google Drive, new ones on tmpfiles.org
- Gradual migration as content is updated

### From Local Storage
- Small files (<50KB) remain in local storage
- Large files automatically use tmpfiles.org hosting
- Best of both worlds: speed + reliability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### File Upload Fails
**Symptoms**: "File hosting upload failed" error
**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify file size is under 10MB
3. Run `FileHostingDebug.testFileIOService()` in console
4. Try uploading a smaller test file

#### File Links Don't Work
**Symptoms**: "File no longer available" or broken links
**Possible Causes**:
1. File expired (after 1 year)
2. file.io service temporarily down
3. File was deleted from file.io servers

#### Cross-Device Sync Issues
**Symptoms**: Files don't appear on other devices
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure JSONhost sync is working
2. Check if notice was saved properly
3. Verify file upload completed successfully
4. Run `FileHostingDebug.getHostedFiles()` to list files

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Service Status**:
   ```javascript
   FileHostingDebug.checkConfig()
   ```

2. **Test Upload**:
   ```javascript
   await FileHostingDebug.testFileUpload()
   ```

3. **List Current Files**:
   ```javascript
   await FileHostingDebug.getHostedFiles()
   ```

4. **Test Service Directly**:
   ```javascript
   await FileHostingDebug.testFileIOService()
   ```

## Monitoring

### Application Logs
- Upload attempts and results logged to console
- File.io responses logged for debugging
- Error messages provide specific guidance

### File Tracking
- All hosted files tracked in notice data
- Upload dates and URLs recorded
- File metadata preserved for reference

## Best Practices

### File Management
1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name files clearly for easy identification
2. **Reasonable Sizes**: Keep files under 5MB for better performance
3. **Appropriate Types**: Use supported file formats
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove outdated notices to clean up files

### Performance
1. **Small Files**: Let small files stay local for speed
2. **Large Files**: Rely on file.io for files >50KB
3. **Image Optimization**: Compress images before upload if needed
4. **File Types**: Use appropriate formats (PDF for documents, JPG for photos)

### Security
1. **Public Files**: Remember that file.io files are publicly accessible
2. **Sensitive Data**: Don't upload confidential information
3. **Temporary Links**: Files expire after 1 year automatically
4. **No Authentication**: Anyone with the URL can access files

## Usage Examples

### Adding Notice with Files
1. Create new notice as admin
2. Add title, content, category
3. Drag & drop files or click "Choose files"
4. Files >50KB automatically upload to file.io
5. Save notice - files sync across all devices

### Viewing Files on Different Device
1. Open notice board on any device
2. Notice loads with file links
3. Click file name to open/download
4. File opens directly from file.io servers

### Managing Large Files
1. Upload documents up to 10MB
2. System automatically uses file.io hosting
3. Direct download links for users
4. No storage limitations

## Support

### file.io Service
